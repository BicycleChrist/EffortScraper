url1:https://www.collegehockeynews.com/stats/team/Air-Force/1
url2:https://www.collegehockeynews.com/schedules/team/Air-Force/1

URL navigation:
base URL: www.collegehockeynews.com/
pages: /stats , /schedules

under /schedules, you can append /team/{ID}
and it will redirect to /schedules/team/{TEAM_NAME}/{ID}
however, this does not work for the 'stats' path

you also don't need to remove the current team name, just changing the ID will redirect.

If the ID doesn't exist, it will redirect to:
https://www.collegehockeynews.com/reports/team/
(removing your invalid ID from the end of the URL as well)

the behavior of '/reports' is the same as schedules

the team IDs seem to be in the range of 1-~64, with two exceptions: Lindenwood and Stonehill; 433 and 422
