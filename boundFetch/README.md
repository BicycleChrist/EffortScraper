# EffortScraper
Dadmin, BicycleChrist, and Dan go on a trip down DataAcquisition drive. 

Sadly, our drive came to a semi dead end, although not a complete waste of gas. NBA.com gives everything they have to cool one off once the agent switches the selenium browser from non-headless mode to headless mode. 
I was not able to get the java script to load with the browser in headless mode despite the numerous work arounds attempted, so this script is limited to use within non-headless mode. If some web scraping chief 
out there could show us the ways of overcoming these blocks that are put in by NBA.com/New Relic, it would be greatly appreciated. 

Directions:

1. Download python if not already installed
2. Create Folder for Virtual enviroment 
3. Set up virtual enviorment within terminal or choice of IDE within created folder
4. Download selenium within the virtual enviroment 
5. Open terminal, run "source venv/bin/activate" or the command specific to the OS your using to activate the VE
6. python3 boundFetch/AssistFetch.py
7. view .csv file output in the Rebounds/Assists Archive folder.
8. Put on a huge NBA slam with the provided addtional conviction of viewing advanced rebounding/passing statistics.
