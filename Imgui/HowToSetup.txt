Dear ImGui (immediate-mode GUI)

# upstream C++ library
https://github.com/ocornut/imgui

# python bindings/port
https://github.com/pyimgui/pyimgui

------------------------------------
All commands written here are in bash

To create a venv:
    python3 -m venv .venv
where '.venv' is the desired name

WARNING: 'venv's are NOT PORTABLE!
Tons of files inside them (including all the modules/libraries) require absolute paths,
so you CANNOT copy/paste them anywhere else. In fact, even renaming parent folders will break them.

then, to run inside of the venv, you have to:
    source ./.venv/bin/activate
you have to do this at the start of every session (persists until terminal exits)

now that you have a venv, you can install imgui (and python-glfw/opengl):
    python3 -m pip install imgui[glfw]
imgui can be installed with support for several backends; glfw and sdl2 are the only relevant ones.
to install everything (useless stuff), you can install imgui[full]
When it runs, it also seems to complain that it wants numpy;
    "Unable to import OpenGL.arrays.numpymodule.NumpyHandler: No numpy module present: No module named 'numpy'"
but it actually seems to run fine without it?
to make the error go away:
    python3 -m pip install numpy


Note that pip's search function (python3 -m pip search ___) is no longer supported.
You have to search the website in a browser instead:
    https://pypi.org/search

now you should be able to import the libraries as long as you're running inside of venv

------------------------
just run ImguiTest.py to get the test GUI.
